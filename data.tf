Arbiters are mongod instances that are part of a replica set but do not hold data (i.e. do not provide data redundancy). They can, however, participate in elections.

Arbiters have minimal resource requirements and do not require dedicated hardware. You can deploy an arbiter on an application server or a monitoring host.

Note: In case if you wish to host MongoDB on Serverless you can go ahead with MongoDb Atlas. Links for the same can be found below:
